## Snapshot
**Snowflake • dbt • Kafka • Spark/PySpark • Azure (ADF/ADLS) • CI/CD • Monitoring • Data Quality**

## Experience highlight
### Staples — Data Engineer Co-op (Jan 2025 – Aug 2025)
- Built Snowflake ELT pipelines processing **multi-source marketplace data**; supported reporting tied to **$180M → $550M** growth.
- Migrated pipelines into **dbt + orchestration (Tidal/ADF)** style modular framework for production rollout.
- Implemented **freshness + validation checks + monitoring** to improve reliability and stakeholder trust.

## Projects
### Apple Media Telemetry Anomaly Detection (Kafka + Spark + GenAI)
- Real-time event-time metrics, regressions by cohort, Streamlit dashboards, RAG incident explanation.

### Real-Time AI Fraud Detection (Kafka + MongoDB Vector Search)
- Change streams + vector similarity for behavior anomalies; low-latency scoring.

### Spark + Delta Lakehouse (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
- Incremental ingestion, deduplication, reconciliation tests, optimized Spark jobs.

## Skills
- Warehousing: Snowflake, dimensional modeling, fact/dim tables  
- Pipelines: batch + streaming, incremental loads, orchestration  
- Reliability: SLAs, monitoring, tests, runbooks
