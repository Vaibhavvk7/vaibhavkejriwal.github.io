## Snapshot
**Noise/Echo Cancellation • Adaptive Filters • MATLAB/Simulink • Control Stability**

## DSP work
### Automatic Voice Recognition with Noise & Echo Removal (MATLAB)
- Adaptive filters: **LMS, RLS, Wiener**, plus **Butterworth**
- Evaluation: SNR/MSE, convergence behavior, noise variance
- Features: MFCC; classifiers: SVM/ANN

## Control work
### Closed-Loop Digital Twin for Fab Control (SimPy + PI Control)
- Modeled downtime & queue dynamics; designed PI WIP control
- Improved cycle time stability & reduced queueing while maintaining throughput

## Teaching
- Lead TA — **DSP (EECE 5666)**: DFT/FFT, FIR/IIR, quantization, sampling
- Lead TA — Image Processing & Pattern Recognition
